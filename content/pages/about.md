Meanwhile,

**Eduardo Gade Gusmão, Ph.D.** is a computational biologist and machine learning specialist with a strong track record in developing scalable, high-impact solutions across genomics, AI, and data-intensive scientific applications. His work combines deep learning, probabilistic modeling, and modern bioinformatics to build tools, pipelines, and models that transform complex biological datasets into actionable insights.

Eduardo’s background spans chromatin biology, multi-omics integration, and the design of ML-driven analytical frameworks for large-scale population and single-cell data. He has contributed to research and software efforts at leading institutions in Brazil, Germany, and the United States, and has collaborated with teams across academia, biotech, and translational research.

He is particularly interested in **AI for genomics**, **computational modeling of chromatin structure**, and **next-generation biomarkers informed by 3D genome architecture and multi-omics signals**. Beyond fundamental research, he focuses on building practical, production-ready tools and algorithms that support real-world applications in precision genomics, aging biology, and therapeutic development.

His broader goal is to bridge scientific depth with engineering rigor — creating systems, models, and software that make biological data more interpretable, scalable, and impactful.
