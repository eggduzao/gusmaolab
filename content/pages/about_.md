**Prof. Dr. MD Eduardo Gade Gusmao** is a Brazilian bioinformatician, professor, and
writer. This site hosts his lab notes, blog posts, creative experiments, and tools for
computer science, biological science, and beyond.

As a computational biologist with a strong focus on the integration of machine/deep
learning, probabilistic modeling, and high-dimensional multi-omics biological data to
elucidate the molecular and chromatin-level mechanisms of aging. His **primary research
interest lies in the study of chromatin conformation and its role in gene regulation,
with the goal of developing Chromatin Architecture Biomarkers (CABs) that can serve as
predictive markers for aging and age-related diseases.** This work bridges computational
and experimental approaches to investigate the intricate relationships between chromatin
structure, epigenetic regulation, and gene expression in both normal and pathological
cellular states.

To this end, he aims to advance methods that leverage hypergraph-based and deep
probabilistic learning techniques to capture and model the spatial organization of
chromatin. **His vision is to establish a novel class of CABs that integrate insights
from multi-omics datasets, enabling precise biomarker identification for aging
interventions and immuno-celular therapies.** With a foundation in both computational
biology and molecular biology, and a growing expertise in laboratory techniques, he is
well-positioned to develop innovative frameworks that unify large-scale multi-omics
data, chromatin architecture studies, and precision medicine approaches to advance the
understanding of cellular aging and to foster translational applications in therapeutic
and pharmacogenomics research.
